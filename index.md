## Introduction

Movies don't just entertainâ€”they inspire and shape how we see the world. A little girl watching a character like her become a doctor might suddenly believe she can do the same. Cinema reflects our emotions and dreams, and in doing so, it helps shape our collective imagination.

Yet, this incredible influence comes with responsibility. Films can perpetuate harmful stereotypes or amplify fear and prejudice. Worse, a lack of representation leaves entire communities invisible, excluded from the collective narrative. Thankfully, awareness of this issue has grown over the past few decades, leading to slow but meaningful progress in diversifying casts.

Today, even the Oscars have introduced diversity quotas for Best Picture eligibility, recognizing the importance of representation in storytelling. But beyond quotas and moral imperatives, there's a compelling question: can a diverse cast also drive cinematic success? Could the power of representation become a key motivator for filmmakers to embrace inclusivity? Let's dive into a data story to uncover the impact of diversity on movie success.

## Setting the Stage: What We're Exploring and How

In this project, we will dive into the provided CMU Movie Summary Corpus Dataset containing 42,306 plot summaries and metadata for films released from 1893 to 2013. To define "success," we have expanded our resources, integrating data on award nominations and audience ratings.

### About the Data

Our primary dataset provides key elements such as:

- Movie Name
- Release Year
- Actor Ethnicity
- Box Office Revenue

To enrich our analysis, we brought in additional datasets:

- IMDb datasets for movie titles and user ratings on a 0-10 scale.
- Award data from globally recognized institutions like the Oscars, Golden Globes, Filmfare, and others.
- A mapping dataset linking Freebase IDs to Wikidata, enabling deeper insights.

### What We'll Explore

We'll tackle some big questions about how cast diversity influences both financial and critical success:

Financial Success:

- Does cast diversity impact box office performance?
- How does this effect vary across genres and budgets?

Critical and Audience Reception:

- Are films with diverse casts more likely to receive award nominations?
- Do they earn higher audience and critic ratings?

(Through data-driven storytelling and interactive visualizations, we aim to uncover patterns, challenge assumptions, and inspire new perspectives. Ready to explore the power of representation in cinema? Let's dive in!)
