This value, derived from the third quartile of the revenue distribution, ensures we are focusing on the top-performing films. Anything below this is not considered a box office hit.</p>

            Together, these criteria provide a multifaceted approach to evaluating a film's overall success‚Äîif a movie meets one or more of these benchmarks, it earns its place as a standout. However, only <span class="highlight">4'726 films</span> in our dataset include box office revenue data. To minimize information loss and ensure a comprehensive analysis, we utilized the full dataset of <span class="highlight">10'000 films</span> when focusing on overall success, particularly for ratings and nominations. For analyses specifically involving box office revenue, we limited our focus to the subset of 1'370 films with recorded values. This approach ensures we make the most of the available data for each success criterion while transparently addressing the limitations posed by missing box office information for the majority of the dataset.
